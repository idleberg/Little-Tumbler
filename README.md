# Little Tumblr

Build your own app to get your favourite Tumblr blog delivered to your [Little Printer](http://bergcloud.com/littleprinter/). This is a work in progress, written from scratch and using [Express](https://npmjs.org/package/express), [Handlebars](https://npmjs.org/package/hbs) and the [Tumblr](https://npmjs.org/package/tumblr) package. Upcoming version might be built upon Roy Lines' [Little Printer](https://npmjs.org/package/littleprinter) package.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/idleberg/Little-Tumbler.git`
2. Run `npm install` in the cloned directory
3. Create a [Tumblr OAuth Key](http://www.tumblr.com/oauth/apps), add it to the header of `app.js`
4. Also fill in a name of a Tumblr blog
5. Start the app using `node app`

Roy Lines has written these [fine instructions](http://roylines.co.uk/2012/10/07/publishing-for-little-printer-using-node-and-heroku.html) on how to use Heroku for hosting
